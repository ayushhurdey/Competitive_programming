/*   ------------------------------PROBLEM STATEMENT-----------------------------------------------------------------
Nestor was doing the work of his math class about three days but he is tired of make operations a                   |
lot and he should deliver his task tomorrow. His mathâ€™s teacher gives him two numbers a and b. The                  |
problem consist of finding the last digit of the potency of base a and index b. Help Nestor with his                |
problem. You are given two integer numbers: the base a (0 <= a <= 20) and the index b (0 <= b <= 2,147,483,000),    |
a and b both are not 0. You have to find the last digit of ab.                                                      |
                                                                                                                    |
Input                                                                                                               |
The first line of input contains an integer t, the number of test cases (t <= 30). t test cases follow.             |
For each test case will appear a and b separated by space.                                                          |
                                                                                                                    |
Output                                                                                                              |
For each test case output an integer per line representing the result.                                              |
                                                                                                                    |
